# Boot sequence & console

> Intro: the real chain is PROM → sash → /unix; Henry collapses this by loading `/unix` directly
> and entering it with the sash→kernel handoff already done (SPB planted, entry registers set).
> Console: the IRIX kernel writes to its **own** console driver — a graphics framebuffer driver for
> `console=g`, or the Z8530 SCC serial driver for `console=d` — it does **NOT** route console
> output through ARCS. Measured over a full boot in MAME: `arcs_write` = 0 calls.

All numbers below were captured by booting real **IRIX 6.5.22** (Indy `indy_4610` / `r4600be`) in
headless MAME with a debugger-driven Lua autoboot script. MAME is the ground-truth oracle.
Cross-refs: `r9999/IRIX_KERNEL_GAPS.md` (console + entry sections), `r9999/IRIX_CPU_REQUIREMENTS.md`
(ARCS/SPB/romvec), `docs/peripherals/ioc2.md` (the SCC console device).

## The boot chain

**Real Indy:** PROM POST (power-on diagnostics) → **sash** (the OSLoader: enumerates RAM via ARCS
`GetMemoryDescriptor` ×14, builds the component/config tree, seeds the wall clock, loads the `/unix`
ELF) → jumps into `/unix` `start`.

**Henry (sash-less / PROM-less):** a shim loads the `/unix` ELF directly and jumps to `start`,
synthesizing the small amount of state sash normally leaves behind. The running kernel barely touches
firmware — over a 100 s emulated boot to multiuser the kernel calls the ARCS romvec **exactly once**
(`GetEnvironmentVariable`). So the shim's job is to leave correct *in-memory* state, not to implement
a live firmware. The collapsed handoff is: **shim → /unix `start` with `a0=8, a1=0, a2=0`.**

## Kernel entry

- **ELF entry = `0x88005960`, symbol `start`.** kseg0-cached vaddr → **PA `0x08005960`**; the image
  loads at VA base `0x88000000` / **PA `0x08000000`** (DRAM `0x08000000`–`0x0fffffff`).
- **Entry registers (measured, NOT argc/argv/envp):** `a0 = 8`, `a1 = 0`, `a2 = 0`, `a3 = 0`.
  `a1`/`a2` are zero — there is no argv/envp array to walk. Only `a0 = 8` carries a value (a small
  boot-type/flag code; exact meaning TBD, boot succeeds regardless). Registers also carry sash
  leftovers (`t0=0x11 t1=7 t2=0x10 t3=0x11 t4=0x12 s6=4 s7=0x01000000 t8=8`) but the shim can enter
  with a clean GPR file. **`SR = 0x30004801`** (reset Status `0x70400004`: KX=0, ERL=1, 32-bit
  kernel).
- **`start` prologue (verified disassembly):** sets `gp = 0x88332bf0`, loads `sp = *(0x8832bfa0)`,
  immediately `sw`s `a0/a1/a2` to gp-relative globals (saves all three boot args), then `jal`s its
  first C routine `0x880255e8(a0,a1,a2,a3=0x880059b0)`. Early calls `_check_dbg`(`0x880255e8`) and
  `debug`(`0x880152c8`) are debug hooks that return.
- The kernel pulls its config from the **ARCS SPB at phys `0x1000`** (signature "ARCS", kseg1
  `0xA0001000`) + a 35-entry FirmwareVector — NOT from the entry registers. RAM size/layout it reads
  **directly from the SGI MC** (`MEMCFG0/1` at phys `0x1fa000c4/0xcc`, via `szmem`@`0x8800790c`),
  not from ARCS. From there it proceeds through early init to multiuser.

## The eaddr requirement — #1 boot gotcha

IRIX's early kernel **PANICs** (UTLB miss around `0x88007488`) if the PROM Ethernet address (`eaddr`)
is unset. In MAME this required a one-time `setenv -f eaddr <mac>` at the PROM prompt or the boot
died before reaching multiuser. **Henry's shim / NVRAM must supply an `eaddr`** (any valid-looking
MAC) or the kernel dies in early init. With a placeholder MAC the kernel boots but later complains
`ec0: machine has bad ethernet address: 08:01:02:03:04:05` and falls back to standalone networking —
harmless for bring-up. Set this first; it is the single most common reason a fresh boot wedges.

## Console — NOT via ARCS

Measured over a whole boot (both `console=g` and `console=d` runs): **`arcs_write` = 0**,
`romvec[Write]` = 0, `call_prom_cached` = 2 (a non-console early PROM query). There is **no early
ARCS console window** — IRIX's own console driver comes up early enough that the firmware console is
never exercised. The console device is selected by the ARCS `console` env var (`arg_console`):

- **`console=g` / `G` (graphics):** kernel's own **graphics framebuffer driver** (over GIO64). This
  is what MAME runs by default; the boot banner is drawn by the kernel, not the firmware.
- **`console=d` (serial duart):** kernel's `cn*` console subsystem dispatches to the serial driver
  `du_*` (`du_putchar` / `ducons_write`), which drives the **Z8530 / SCC85230** in the **IOC2/INT2**
  ASIC directly. `du_putchar` works through a per-port struct at kdata `0x8832d670 + port*0x84`; the
  mapped SCC base is stored there at driver init.

**Important:** the "free output via the ARCS `Write` hook (`arcs_fw`)" trick does **not** work for
the IRIX kernel console. Both the PROM phase ("Running power-on diagnostics…") and the kernel phase
("IRIX Release 6.5 IP22…") write the Z8530 **directly**. A `du_putchar`/`ducons_write` entry
breakpoint *undercounts* TX (output is buffered / interrupt-driven); the SCC-write hook (`scc_dc_w`
in MAME `src/mame/sgi/ioc2.cpp`) is ground truth — it caught 972 console bytes.

### For a HEADLESS Henry: set `console=d` and emulate the minimal SCC

Indy console = Port 1, channel A, at IOC2 base `0x1FBD9800`. The whole console is two registers
(cross-ref `docs/peripherals/ioc2.md`):

- **Write `0x1FBD9834`** (Port1 chan A data) → take `data[7:0]`, append to the console sink (stdout).
  That byte is the printed character — this is `du_putchar`'s store.
- **Read `0x1FBD9830`** (Port1 chan A command / RR0) → always return **`0x04`** (RR0 bit2 = Tx Buffer
  Empty), so the driver's "wait for Tx empty" poll (`while(!(RR0 & 4));`) never stalls.
- **Write `0x1FBD9830`** → swallow (WR-pointer selects / WR-register loads: baud, mode, IE). Henry
  models no SCC register file; a stateless drain ignores them.

That stateless polled-TX drain is enough to print. The SCC interrupt path (mappable int, Map Status
`0x9890` bit5) is **not** needed — IRIX's `du` driver polls RR0.

## What "booted" looks like (serial transcript, `console=d`)

```
                         Running power-on diagnostics...
                           Starting up the system...
               To perform system maintenance instead, press <Esc>

```

The PROM-phase lines ("Running power-on diagnostics…", "press &lt;Esc&gt;") are **PROM** code writing
the Z8530; the "IRIX Release 6.5 IP22…" banner onward is the **kernel's** serial driver writing the
Z8530. (Henry is PROM-less, so the PROM-phase lines won't appear; the kernel banner is the first
output.) Full capture: `~/code/mame/irix_serial_console.txt`.

## Minimum for Henry to print "IRIX is alive"

1. Load the `/unix` ELF (VA `0x88xxxxxx` → PA `0x08xxxxxx`, base PA `0x08000000`).
2. Plant the **ARCS shim**: SPB at phys `0x1000` (sig "ARCS" + field layout) → 35-entry romvec with
   a working **GetEnvironmentVariable** (the one call the kernel makes); return sane **MEMCFG0/1**
   from the MC model (e.g. `MEMCFG0=0x23200000` → bank @ `0x08000000`).
3. Provide an **`eaddr`** in the ARCS env / NVRAM (see the eaddr gotcha above) — or early init panics.
4. Set **`console=d`** in the ARCS env.
5. Enter `start` (`0x88005960`) with **`a0=8, a1=0, a2=0`**, clean GPRs, `SR=0x30004801`.
6. Emulate the **minimal Z8530 SCC** at IOC2 (write `0x1FBD9834` = TX byte → stdout; read
   `0x1FBD9830` → `0x04`; swallow writes to `0x1FBD9830`).

With those six, the kernel runs through early init and its `du` driver prints the IRIX banner to
Henry's serial sink.
